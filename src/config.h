 * And finally, remember that the "Makefile" will specify some rather

/*
 * OPTION: See the Makefile(s), where several options may be declared.
 *
 * Some popular options include "USE_GCU" (allow use with Unix "curses"),
 * and "USE_X11" (allow basic use with Unix X11).
 *
 * The old "USE_NCU" option has been replaced with "USE_GCU".
 *
 * Several other such options are available for non-unix machines,
 * such as "MACINTOSH", "WINDOWS".

/*
 * OPTION: Set the "default" path to the angband "lib" directory.
 *
 * See "main.c" for usage, and note that this value is only used on
 * certain machines, primarily Unix machines.  If this value is used,
 * it will be over-ridden by the "ANGBAND_PATH" environment variable,
 * if that variable is defined and accessable.  The final slash is
 * optional, but it may eventually be required.
 *
 * Using the value "./lib/" below tells Angband that, by default,
 * the user will run "angband" from the same directory that contains
 * the "lib" directory.  This is a reasonable (but imperfect) default.
 *
 * If at all possible, you should change this value to refer to the
 * actual location of the "lib" folder, for example, "/tmp/angband/lib/"
 * or "/usr/games/lib/angband/", or "/pkg/angband/lib".
 *
 * Additional note -- if you are planning to use makefile.org, don't bother
 * setting this variable, as it is overridden by a value set near the top of
 * that file.
