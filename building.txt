Using the CMake build system
============================

There are basically two options for how to run ToME once built.



Option #1 : Run ToME from the build directory
=============================================

Simply run the commands below.

       $ cmake .
       $ make

You should now be able to run

       $ ./src/tome2

to start ToME.

This is currently the recommended option.



Option #2: Run ToME from a system install location
==================================================

Run

        $ cmake -DSYSTEM_INSTALL:BOOL=true .
        $ make
        $ sudo make install

You can now run ToME from anywhere.

NOTE: The user running ToME must have write access to the
install location's lib/data subdirectory for the first run.
(This is because the *.raw files will be generated the first
time ToME is run.)

You can also use DESTDIR when installing to install into a different
location (useful with e.g. stow or when building distribution packages).
