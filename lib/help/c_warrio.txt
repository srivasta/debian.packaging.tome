#####R=== Warriors ===

#####GDescription
A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his problems
by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help 
of a magical device. Their prime stats are Strength and Constitution, 
and a good Dexterity can really help at times. A Warrior will be good 
at Fighting and Throwing/Bows, but bad at most other skills.
A Warrior learns no magic.
