The mana school of magic contains spells where the raw force of magic is used
to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of a "Tome of Magical 
Energy" which contains all the mana school spells within it's bindings.

Worshipping the God Eru Iluvatar also gives the ability to cast spells from
the mana school at a level of 1/2 of your prayer level. e.g. If the skill 
"Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 10, you can cast up to level 5 mana school
spells.

<FONT COLOR="#808080">Mana Spells</FONT>
There are four spells available for the mana school. These Spells are:
1. <FONT COLOR="#808080">Manathrust</FONT> (school level 1)
   Conjures up mana into a powerful bolt.
   The damage is irresistible and will increase with spell level
2. <FONT COLOR="#808080">Remove Curses</FONT> (school level 10)
   Remove curses of worn objects.
   At spell level 20 switches to *remove curses*
3. <FONT COLOR="#808080">Elemental Shield</FONT> (school level 20)
   Provide resistances to the four basic elements.
4. <FONT COLOR="#808080">Disruption Shield</FONT> (school level 45)
   Uses mana instead of hitpoints to take damage.
   At spell level 5 switches to Globe of Invulnerability.
   The spell breaks as soon as a melee, shooting, throwing or magical skill
   action is attempted, and lasts only a short time.
