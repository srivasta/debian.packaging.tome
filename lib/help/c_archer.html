<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>
Archers are to bows what warriors are to melee. They are the best class
around with any bow/crossbow/sling/boomerang. 

Needing a lot of ammo, they will learn early how to make it from junk found
in the dungeons. They also gain, at skill level 20, the unique ability to make 
their arrows/bolts/shots pierce through monsters!

An Archer begins the game with:
    a Short Bow
    a Sling
    some ammo
<A NAME="03"></A><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Creating AMmo</FONT>
Archers automatically gain the <A HREF="ability.html#7">Ammo Creation</A> ability when they reach character 
level 2. (Other classes can purchase this ability when they have enough skill 
points.) This ability is accessed via the 'm' command. You need dungeon junk to 
make ammo. Each type of ammo requires certain kinds of junk. The first type of 
ammo you can make is pebbles; as you increase in skill you'll be able to make 
other types.
