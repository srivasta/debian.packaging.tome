There are numerous dungeons within Middle-earth, but not all
of them are required to be ventured into. The original Angband
dungeon has been split into 4 parts, each found near or at a
different town. Travel between towns is usually easiest by
using the wilderness overview map ("<" from the town level),
but remember to take lots of food with you!

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">The Basic Dungeons</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">------------------</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">1. Barrow-Downs</FONT>
Found near the outskirts of Bree (the starting town), this
dungeon is where you should begin your adventure. It
contains the main Dungeon levels 1 (50') to 10 (500'),
after which it becomes necessary for the character to seek
out a new dungeon in order to be able to descend further in
their quest to kill Morgoth.

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">2. Mirkwood</FONT>
The Mirkwood forest contains levels 11 (550') to 33 (1650'),
and can be found to the north-east of Lothlorien.

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">3. Mordor</FONT>
The Land of Mordor is a hot, cavernous region, containing
levels 34 (1700') to 66 (3300') of the dungeon. Located to
the East of Minas Anor, it is a place filled with danger,
and only a wary adventurer will make it through to the other
end of this dungeon.

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">4. Angband</FONT>
Only the most successful of adventurers usually make it this
far. The Dungeon Angband contains both Sauron and Morgoth,
who will gladly wipe out any who dare to oppose them! This
dungeon covers levels 67 (3350') to 127 (6350'), but Sauron
waits for you at level 99, and Morgoth at level 100. This
dungeon can be found near Gondolin.


<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Additional ToME Dungeons</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">------------------------</FONT>

In addition to the basic 4 dungeons, there are numerous other
dungeons scattered around the world for an adventurer to explore
while preparing for the final fight. Many of the dungeons have a
guardian at the bottom of them, and a few have unique levels
somewhere within them (like an orc town) with guaranteed artifacts
and nasties within them. Other than the unique levels, all of the
dungeons can be exited and re-entered at your leisure.

Be warned though that some dungeons are partly toxic to the
adventurer, and will damage you BY THEMSELVES just by you walking
within them!
