The mind school of magic contains spells which alter the mind. There are
rumours of a "Tome of the Mind" which contains all the mind school spells
within it's bindings.

Worshipping the God Eru Iluvatar or the God Melkor Bauglir also gives the
ability to cast spells from the mind school at a level of 1/3 of your prayer
level. e.g. If the skill "Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 12, you can cast
up to level 4 mind school spells.

<FONT COLOR="#808080">Mind Spells</FONT>
There are four spells available for the mind school. These Spells are:
1. <FONT COLOR="#808080">Charm</FONT> (school level 1)
   Tries to manipulate the mind of a monster to make it friendly.
   At spell level 15 it turns into a ball.
   At spell level 35 it affects all monsters in sight.
2. <FONT COLOR="#808080">Confuse</FONT> (school level 5)
   Tries to manipulate the mind of a monster to confuse it.
   At spell level 15 it turns into a ball.
   At spell level 35 it affects all monsters in sight.
3. <FONT COLOR="#808080">Armor of Fear</FONT> (school level 10)
   Creates a shield of pure fear around you. Any monster attempting to hit
   you must save or flee.
4. <FONT COLOR="#808080">Stun</FONT> (school level 15)
   Tries to manipulate the mind of a monster to stun it.
   At spell level 20 it turns into a ball.

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Fire spells that can be cast with Mind skill</FONT>

1. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Fire Golem</FONT> (school level 7)
   Creates a fiery golem and controls it.
   During the control the available keylist is:
   Movement keys: move the golem(depending on its speed it can move more
         than one square).
      , : pickup all items on the floor
      d : drop all carried items
      i : list all carried items
      m : end the possession/use golem powers
      Most of the other keys are disabled, you cannot interact with your
      real body while controlling the golem.
   But to cast the spell you will need a lantern or a wooden torch to create
      the golem from.
<FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">   Your Fire and Mind skills must have reached a combined average level </FONT>
