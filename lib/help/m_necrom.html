The art of Necromancy is the foul practice of manipulating the life
force of creatures.

Necromancy powers are accessed using the 'm' key and then selecting
'Use Necromancy'; they are cast with Spell Points, like normal spells,
and do not need light to be performed.

1. <FONT COLOR="#404040">Horrify</FONT> (Level 1) Cost:2
   Calls upon the dark forces and open a channel into the mind of a
   monster, stunning and scaring it.
   At level 21 it affects all monsters in a beam.
   At level 36 it affects all monsters in a ball.
   At level 46 it affects all monsters in sight.
2. <FONT COLOR="#404040">Raise Dead</FONT> (Level 5) Cost:6
   This power makes corpses in a small radius from the caster rise as an
   undead ego monster at the service of the caster. The loyalty of those
   monsters is not guaranteed, though. It also heals monsters within the
   same radius.
3. <FONT COLOR="#404040">Necromantic Teeth</FONT> (Level 12) Cost:20
   This conjures up a temporary vampiric weapon.
4. <FONT COLOR="#404040">Absorb Soul</FONT> (Level 20) Cost:10
   This heals you by a good amount every time you kill a monster within
   its duration. It is especially useful when your character is in 
   in <A HREF="ability.html#12">Undead Form</A>.
5. <FONT COLOR="#404040">Vampirism</FONT> (Level 30) Cost:15
   Drains part of the life-force from a nearby monster and gives it to you.
6. <FONT COLOR="#404040">Death</FONT> (Level 35) Cost:100
   Yes, the name is not nice. Neither are the effects: the target dies
   immediately, but so does your character (note that death is not such a great
   annoyance for necromancers)
