<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>
As undead beings, skeletons need to worry very little about poison or 
attacks that can drain life. They do not really use eyes for perceiving 
things, and are thus not fooled by invisibility. Their bones are resistant 
to sharp shrapnels (not much to cut there), and they will quickly become 
resistant to cold. It is very hard for skeletons to eat food or drink potions. 
Although the magical effects of these will affect the skeleton even without 
entering the skeleton's (non-existent) belly, the potion / food itself will
fall through the skeleton's jaws, giving no nutritional benefit.
