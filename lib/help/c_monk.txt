#####GDescription
The Monk character class is very different from all other classes. 
Although they can use weapons and armour just like any other class, 
their training in martial arts makes them much more powerful with no 
armour nor weapons. To gain the resistances necessary for survival at 
higher levels a monk may need to wear some kind of armour, but if the 
armour worn is too heavy, it will severely disturb their martial arts 
maneuvers. As the monk gains in skill, new, powerful forms of attack 
become available. Their defensive capabilities (blocking and dodging) 
increase likewise, but if armour is being worn, this effect decreases. 
Fortunately, the amount of armour a monk can wear while still fighting 
efficiently can be increased by raising his/her Barehanded-combat skill. 
It is rumoured that the monastic training even makes monks faster than 
any other character class! 

Monks also have access to the schools of *****m_meta.txt*0[Meta], *****m_tempo.txt*0[Temporal] and *****m_mind.txt*0[Mind] magic.
