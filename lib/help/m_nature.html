The nature school of magic contains spells that interact with nature. There
are rumours of a "Tome of the Tree" which contains all the nature school
spells within its bindings.

Worshipping the Goddess Yavanna Kementari also gives the ability to cast spells
from the nature school at a level of 1/2 of your prayer level. e.g. If the skill
"Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 10, you can cast up to level 5 nature school
spells.
