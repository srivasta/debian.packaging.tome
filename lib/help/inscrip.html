<A NAME="01"></A><A NAME="02"></A><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== Floor Inscriptions ===    </FONT>
    
It is possible to inscribe words on the floor in ToME. If you happen
to be lucky and inscribe a spell formula from another language, the inscription
will use the floor's mana to cast that spell when either you walk over it, a 
monster walks over it, or both walk over it. Not all inscriptions are triggered
by monsters, and not all can be triggered by the player.

In order to write an inscription in another language, you must first have found
and read a parchment with some of that language's words upon it. So, just 
copying the inscriptions here won't work unless you have read the words on a 
parchment first ;-).
