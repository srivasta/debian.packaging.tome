<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>
Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at ranged combat (especially with slings),
throwing, and have good saving throws. They also are very good at searching,
disarming, perception and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but prefer
to be called burglars.  They are much weaker than humans, and no good at melee
fighting.  Halflings have fair infra-vision, so they can detect warm creatures at a
distance. Hobbits have their dexterity sustained and in time they learn to cook a
delicious meal from available ingredients.
Their sturdy constitutions also allow them to resist the insidious poison of the
ring-wraiths.
