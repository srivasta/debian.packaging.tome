As well as spending your skill points on <A HREF="skills.html">skills</A>, you can also choose
to spend them on abilities. 
Abilities are bought once, and then have a permanent effect. You cannot 
continue adding skill points into them, (which you can with <A HREF="skills.html">skills</A>) as there 
would be no way that these abilities can improve. They are a "one-off 
purchase".
As a consequence of this, they are often quite powerful abilities and can 
cost quite a few skill points to buy.
Most abilities have a prerequisite skill or stat level which you must reach 
before being able to buy.

For instance, you can invest in the <A HREF="ability.html#3">Tree walking</A> ability. This will allow 
you to pass through dense undergrowth. In order to purchase this skill you must 
first have your <A HREF="skills.html#34">Nature</A> skill at 20 or greater, and then it will cost you 7 
skill points to buy. This means you have to "save up" enough skill points in
order to be able to afford this ability.

You can access the Ability screen by pressing 'N'. Scroll up and down the 
abilities and then navigate right to buy selected ability.

Adapt your character with skills and abilities in order to make it unique, 
playable, and maybe even powerful enough to win the game!
