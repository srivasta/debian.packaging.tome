<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>
Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than most other character
races, so they make great warriors. They are also very stupid and slow. They are
bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They are so ugly that an
Orc grimaces in their presence. They also happen to be fun to play...
Trolls always have their strength sustained. At higher levels, Trolls learn to 
enter a berserk fury, and regenerate wounds automatically.
