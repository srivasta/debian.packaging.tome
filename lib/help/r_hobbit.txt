#####R=== Hobbits ===

#####GDescription
Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at ranged combat (especially with slings),
throwing, and have good saving throws. They also are very good at searching,
disarming, perception and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but prefer
to be called burglars. They are much weaker than humans, and no good at melee
fighting. Halflings have fair infra-vision, so they can detect warm creatures at a 
distance. Hobbits have their dexterity sustained and in time they learn to cook a 
delicious meal from available ingredients.
Their sturdy constitutions also allow them to resist the insidious poison of the
ring-wraiths
