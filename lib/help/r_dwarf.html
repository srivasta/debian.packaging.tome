<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>
Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. Since dungeons 
are the natural home of a dwarf, they are excellent choices for a warrior 
or priest. Dwarves tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less 
intelligent than humans. Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat 
wise, they resist spells which are cast on them. Dwarves also have very 
good infra-vision because they live underground. They do have one big 
drawback, though. Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud 
voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason, and screaming out 
challenges at nearby foes. In other words, dwarves have miserable 
stealth. They can never be blinded and can also open secret passages.
