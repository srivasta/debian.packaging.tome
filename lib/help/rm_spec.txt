#####R=== Spectral Race ===

#####GDescription
Another powerful undead creature: the spectre is a ghastly apparition, 
surrounded by an unearthly green glow. They exist only partially on our 
plane of existence: half-corporeal, they can pass through walls. The 
spectre can scream an eldritch howl, which is enough to scare lesser 
monsters witless. As undead, they have a firm hold on their life force, 
see invisible, and resist poison and cold. They also resist nether; in 
fact, their half-corporeal form actually grows stronger from the effects 
of nether. At higher levels they develop telepathic abilities. Spectres
make superb spellcasters, but their physical form is very weak. Like 
Zombies, Spectres gain almost no nutrition from ordinary food.
