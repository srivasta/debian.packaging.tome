<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>
Symbiants live in harmony with all of the monsters that do not move;
the Mushrooms, Molds, Floating Eyes, and such. They can hypnotise these
creatures and then form a symbiotic relationship. Using other symbiotic
powers, they can even use the magical abilities of their pets.

Once hypnotised, the monster is placed onto the body, or "worn" in order to 
initiate the symbiotic relationship.

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Starting Equipment</FONT>
A Symbiant begins the game with:
    a Dagger
    a Scroll of Summon Never-Moving Pet


<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Symbiosis</FONT>
Symbiants rely on the partnerships they form, hypnotising creatures
and then "wearing" them: "I get by with a little help from my friends".
Depending on the monster, this does nothing except protect the player
slightly (the worn monster takes some of the damage the player would
otherwise) or grant some very powerful attacks and summons.
Their "spells" are used by the 'm' command; as their Symbiosis skill
raises, they automatically gain more powers.
For more detail about the specific powers, look here: <A HREF="m_symbio.html">Symbiosis</A>
<A NAME="03"></A><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Naming your symbiote</FONT>
For those sentimental Symbiants who like to name your symbiotes, you 
can use the Inscribe command '{'. Inscribe your hypnotized symbiote 
with "#named Fido" (or whatever name you choose, but don't forget the 
leading '#'), and it will be listed in your equipment as "a Red Mold 
named Fido", and the game will refer to your symbiote by name ("Fido 
is healed", for instance, rather than "Your Red mold is healed").
