#####R=== Sorcerors ===

#####GDescription
Sorcerors are to magic what unbelievers are to melee. They are the all-
around best magicians, being able to cast spells from any school using
only a single skill. On the downside, they are the worst fighters, being
unable to use any weapon but a Mage Staff comfortably, and still unable
to be anything even remotely approaching effective with it.
The energies used for learning sorcery also sap the life force of a
sorcerer, penalising them with the loss of a percentage of their hit
points equal to their sorcery skill score and penalising their combat
ability even more strongly.
