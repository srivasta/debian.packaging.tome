The Udun school of magic contains spells where the corrupted forces of Melkor
Bauglir are used to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of an
"Unholy Tome of the Hellflame" which contains all the Udun school spells within
it's bindings.

The Udun school is available only to a worshipper of <A HREF="g_melkor.html">Melkor Bauglir</A>. They will also
need some proficiency in the magic schools of Mana, Nature, Conveyance, and Fire
(or alternatively Sorcery) to cast the Udun spells. On the other hand the spell
power of Udun spells is greatly increased by the level of the caster.
