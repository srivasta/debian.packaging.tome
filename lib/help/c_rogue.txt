#####R== Rogues ===

#####GDescription
Rogues are jacks of all trades, but master of none. With the notable exception
of Archery and Monster-related skills, they are capable of adapting to any
situation. Their strong point, anyhow, lies in stealth and careful planning:
Where a warrior would simply hack away (and risk being hacked up himself) or a 
mage would Manathrust, a Rogue would awaken a monster with a dagger in the back,
or wait for the creature to be killed by the line of traps she had previously
laid between her and her opponent.

Rogues have access to the schools of *****m_convey.txt*0[Conveyance], *****m_divin.txt*0[Divination] and *****m_tempo.txt*0[Temporal] magic.
