The principle way for your character to gain experience (XP) is to kill 
monsters. 
There are a few other ways too, like lockpicking, but these only give small 
rewards.

Once your character has gained enough experience to go up a level, then he/she 
should will be given skill points to spend as you see fit. These points can be 
spent on 
either

    <A HREF="skills.html">(a) Skills</A> which improve more for each point you put into them, 
or
    <A HREF="ability.html">(b) Abilities</A> which are one off purchases and grant your character new, 
    non-improvable powers
    
Certain monsters can "drain" your experience, and thus your level. Although you
do not lose the skill points you've already gained, you also will not gain
further points until you reach a character level you have not already
achieved. Luckily, you can restore drained experience through magical means,
or by simply regaining the experience all over again.
