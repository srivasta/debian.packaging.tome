#####R=== Zombie Race ===

#####GDescription
Much like Skeletons, Zombies too are undead horrors: they are resistant to
life-draining attacks, and can learn to restore their life-force. Like 
skeletons, they become resistant to cold-based attacks (actually earlier 
than skeletons), resist poison and can see invisible. While still 
vulnerable to cuts (unlike skeletons), Zombies are resistant to Nether. 
They gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals. However, Zombies
are, as the name implies, practically mindless.
