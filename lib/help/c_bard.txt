#####R=== Bards ===

#####GDescription
Bards are traditional musicians. Their magical attacks are sound-based, and 
last as long as the Bard has mana. If the Bard runs out of mana, he/she stops
singing. There is also a low-level "spell" that will cease the song.

While any class can use musical instruments, only Bards can tap the 
power of voice to aid themselves and hinder, dismay, and kill their 
foes. 

#####GMagic Usage

In order to continue playing a song, mana is consumed each turn, until 
either the 'Stop Singing' song is sung, or the player's mana runs out.

Each song, as well as having a school level like any other magic spell also
has a roman numeral following its name. The higher the number of these numerals,
the more skillful the adventurer must be to play it.

Each musical instrument has a value assigned to it as well, between 1 and 4. The
higher the number, the better the craftmanship, and hence it will be possible
for the bard to play higher level songs only with a more powerful instrument.
Thus a Harp(+1) will allow you to cast "Stop Singing(I)" and "Song of the
Sun(I)". A Harp(+2) would allow you to sing those songs, as well as "Flow of
Life(II)".
