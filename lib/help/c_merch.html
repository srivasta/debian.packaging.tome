<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>
A Merchant is neither a warrior nor a spellcaster. They still have some great
advantages, they can use chests to warp items into other items, they can
indentify items, they soon learn to detect all objects in the area, and
at higher level they can see all monsters carrying objects. They will also
get the power to appraise items and to turn them into gold. A merchant will
naturraly get better prices in shops and get access to the merchant guild
services, loan and item request.
