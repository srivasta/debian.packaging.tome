Numerous spirits inhabit the land of Arda, from the murderous barrow wights to
the enigmatic Tom Bombadil. These spirits usually are bound to a specific
geographic region, but there are exceptions to this rule. Sometimes one of
these spirits will take  interest in an adventurer. This can either be very,
very good or very, very bad. These spirits will "rig" reality to ensure that
something happens--or doesn't happen.

In order to attract the attention of a spirit, the adventurer must be somewhat
experienced, having attained at least the 11th level of experience. Every 10
game turns, which corresponds to 1 normal speed player turn, there is a
1 in 50,000 chance of gaining a fate. When this fate is chosen, there is a
7/18 chance of being fated to find a specific mundane item on a specific
dungeon level. A more belligerent spirit will, 7/18 of the time, summon a
malicious monster to do battle a specific dungeon level. There
is a 1/9 chance to be destined to find an artifact on a given
level. There is also a 1/18 chance that you will meet your demise on a given
level. Finally, there is a 1/18 chance of becoming invulnerable to attacks
from mortals.

Whenever a level is being chosen for a fate, it is always chosen within 20
levels of your current recall depth. Items, monsters, and artifacts are all
generated up to 10 levels out of depth for your current recall depth.
