<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== Introduction ===</FONT>

Adding a quest involves a bit more work, and there is, in some ways, rather 
more potential for things to go wrong! Bit it's a great way of showing just 
WHAT can be done with lua scripting. It proves just how much a lua patch can 
change the overall feel of the game. And it will give you a much better idea of 
how lua interfaces with the game source. You should have read the 
<A HREF="lua_intr.html">scripting introduction</A>, <A HREF="lua_pow.html">racial power tutorial</A>
and <A HREF="lua_skil.html">adding new skills tutorial</A> before going much 
further. All of the above files contain some fairly fundamental information 
which you will find necessary for full understanding of this file.

The script we're looking at is going to create a quest entrance in the middle 
of Bree. Entering the quest you see a little girl who has had her necklace 
stolen. Your job is to travel down a corridor, killing some monsters on the 
way, pick up the amulet and return it to the girl. Once done, she'll reveal the 
stairs back to Bree, and give you a (randomly generated) ring. If you feel the 
monsters are too hard, the only thing to do is talk to the little girl who will 
reveal the stairs again, failing the quest for you, and also block off the 
entrance to the amulet so that you can't cheat and make off with the amulet!

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== Getting started ===</FONT>

Open amulet.lua (you have downloaded the example scripts from 
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">http://www.moppy.co.uk/angband.htm</FONT>, haven't you?). The first thing you 
should see is that yet again we're calling a function that takes it's arguments 
from a table, making it easy to read what's going on in the script.

This time our function is add_quest and we have the following keys and values:

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">["global"] =    "AMULET_QUEST",</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">["name"] =      "Hannahs lost amulet",</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">["desc"] =      {</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  "Retrieve an amulet for Hannah Cooke. It's guarded!"</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">               },</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">["level"] =     5,</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">["hooks"] =     {</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"global" = </FONT>      is a constant that we set when we refer to this quest in 
various places...
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"name" = </FONT>        Obviously a long name for the quest. This will appear in the 
quest screen (Ctrl-Q) and we may use in some map files too.
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"desc" = </FONT>        This is a long description for the quest. Again this is what 
will appear in the quest screen, and each line should be not more than 80 
characters.
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"level" = </FONT>       This is a rough indicator of how hard the quest is, and again, 
appears in the quest screen
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"hooks" = </FONT>       This is the real 'meat' of the quest. Like the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"spell_list"</FONT> key 
in the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">add_magic</FONT> function, this is another sub-table.

To understand fully the structure of the "hooks" key it's worth taking a bit of 
a detour at this point and discussing  the scripting interface works  in 
general.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== How the scripts work (ish) ===</FONT>

Essentially there's a list of events that happen in the game. As each of these 
events happen they run a check to see if there's any functions that they need 
to run at that event. When we ran the add_mkey part of adding a new skill 
power, we essentially said 'when the 'm' key is pressed in the game, perform 
the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">execute_magic(constructor_powers)</FONT> function'. Likewise we did a similar 
thing with adding the racial power, only we hooked onto the pressing of the 
'U' key.

All of this was partly hidden because of the way that the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">add_magic</FONT> and 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">add_power</FONT> functions work. But here in the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">add_quest</FONT> function it's a bit more 
specific. We are going to specify what events we're going to hook onto, and 
what functions we want to trigger at that event.

A full list of hooks can be found in the source-file util.pkg.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== The hooks ===</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">[HOOK_BIRTH_OBJECTS] = function()</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  quest(AMULET_QUEST).status = QUEST_STATUS_TAKEN</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">end,</FONT>

So here we are with our first hook. We've declared that we're adding it to the 
birth of your character. That is, the function will be called when you create 
your character. And what we're doing here is automatically declaring the quest 
as being taken, like the Dol Guldur quest is. Each quest has 7 different 
statuses:

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">QUEST_STATUS_IGNORED         -1   </FONT>       This is unused, but the quest is 
ignored (will not be taken and has not been taken).
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">QUEST_STATUS_UNTAKEN         0    </FONT>       The quest has not been accepted yet
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">QUEST_STATUS_TAKEN           1    </FONT>       You have accepted the quest
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETED       2    </FONT>       You have completed the quest 
successfully but not been rewarded for it
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">QUEST_STATUS_REWARDED        3    </FONT>       You've completed and rewarded the quest
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">QUEST_STATUS_FAILED          4    </FONT>       You've failed the quest
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">QUEST_STATUS_FINISHED        5    </FONT>       The quest is completely finished 
successfully.
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">QUEST_STATUS_FAILED_DONE     6    </FONT>       The quest is completely finished 
unsuccessfully.

You see that we've used the constant we defined in the "global" section is 
passed as an argument to <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">quest.status</FONT>.

Next hook then:

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">[HOOK_GEN_QUEST] = function()</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  if (player.inside_quest ~= AMULET_QUEST) then</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          return FALSE</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  else</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          load_map("amulet.map", 2, 2)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          return TRUE</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  end</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">end,</FONT>

Ok we're hooking onto the generation of the quest here. This is specifically 
triggered in this instance by the going down the quest entrance stairs in Bree.
Once you've gone down the stairs, you are technically inside the quest, which 
means we can say if the person is not inside the amulet quest, then ignore this 
function, otherwise load the file 'amulet.map' at co-ordinates x=2 y=2. You'll 
find the amulet.map file in the edit directory, make sure you check it out. The 
syntax for map files is fairly simple, though I might get round to writing a 
tutorial on them some day! In the mean time holler for me at the usual email 
address if you're unsure.

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">[HOOK_FEELING] = function()</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  if (player.inside_quest ~= AMULET_QUEST) then</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          return FALSE</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  else</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          cmsg_print(TERM_L_BLUE, "Hannah speaks to you:")</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          cmsg_print(TERM_YELLOW, "'Some nasty monsters stole my </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                                  favourite necklace.'")</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          cmsg_print(TERM_YELLOW, "'It's hidden at the back of that </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                          corridor! Please fetch it for me'")</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          return TRUE</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  end</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">end,</FONT>

We're moving into some rather more obvious territory here, and getting into the 
meat of the quest. The <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">HOOK_FEELING</FONT> is triggered at the point when the level 
feeling appears. It's important that this is run only if the player is inside 
the amulet quest, as otherwise it will trigger EVERY time a level feeling 
occurs, when you go down a level in the barrow-downs, whenever! Returning TRUE 
will replace the level feeling with what's above, returning FALSE will still 
perform the function but will amend the normal level feeling - so here if we'd 
returned false we'd still get out custom messages, but they'd follow with 
'looks like a typical quest level'. Of course returning false may cause you 
other problems (see end of this file!) depending on what else you have in your 
function.

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">[HOOK_GIVE] = function(m_idx, item)</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  m_ptr = monster(m_idx)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  o_ptr = get_object(item)</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  if (m_ptr.r_idx == test_monster_name("Hannah Cooke, a little girl")) </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  and (o_ptr.tval == TV_AMULET) and (o_ptr.sval == 2) then</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          cmsg_print(TERM_YELLOW, "'Thank-you!'")</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          inven_item_increase(item, -1)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          inven_item_optimize(item)</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          quest(AMULET_QUEST).status = QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETED</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          cave_set_feat(7, 6, 6)</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          cmsg_print(TERM_YELLOW, "'Here, take this pretty ring I found </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                                  as a token of gratitude!'")</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          random_type = randint(57)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          reward = create_object(TV_RING, random_type)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          drop_near(reward, -1, py, px)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          quest(AMULET_QUEST).status = QUEST_STATUS_REWARDED</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          return TRUE</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  else</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          return FALSE</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  end</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">end,</FONT>

this is a fairly long function, but don't be intimidated. It's not really 
difficult to understand. As you can see we're hooking into the giving of an 
object to a monster( the 'y' key). Because of this, the function takes two 
arguments - <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">m_idx</FONT> (the monster that you're giving to) and <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">item</FONT> (the item that 
you're giving).

We then make it possible to work with the monster and item variables by 
referencing them to two functions which identify them from the edit files: 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">monster()</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_object()</FONT>. This enables us to now say, 'if the name of the 
monster is "Hannah Cooke, a little girl" and the type of item is an amulet and 
that amulet is an amulet of adornment, then carry out the following commands'.

We then say call the function <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">inven_item_increase()</FONT> which places an object in 
the inventory. It takes two arguments, the first being what object to put in 
the inventory and the second being how many of that type of objects to put in 
the inventory. You can see that by placing -1 as the second argument it fairly 
obviously subtracts that item from the inventory. The <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">inven_item_optimize()</FONT> 
function checks that there are no empty inventory slots, and if there are, 
erases them. 

The quest is then completed, and the stairs are revealed using the 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">cave_set_feat()</FONT> function. This function takes three arguments, the first is the 
x co-ordinate of the cave square you wish to change (counted from top left) the 
second is the y co-ordinate, and the third is the index number of the feature 
you wish the square to become as defined in f_info.txt. 

We then set about rewarding the player. As you can see we <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">call create_object()</FONT> 
which takes two variables: the first is the type of object (these are all 
listed in object.pkg) and the second is the sub-type of that object. I searched 
k_info.txt to see how many different types of ring there were (57) and used a 
randomly selected number with a maximum value of 57 as that specific sub-type.

We then drop the object (although it's been created, it has only been created 
in the game's memory, it's nowhere that the player can interact with it until 
we drop it). The <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">drop_near()</FONT> function takes 3 variables, the first being the 
object that you wish to drop, the second being the chance that it disappears 
(like an arrow, or mimicked creature) on drop. If you set it to -1, it wont 
ever disappear. the last two are the co-ordinates at which the object will be 
dropped. py and px are the global variables defined by where the player is 
standing, so in this case it will drop under the player. You could do 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">inven_item_increase(reward, 1)</FONT> if you wanted, but I wanted to show a variety of 
ways of handling objects.

OK lets take a look at the next hook:

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">[HOOK_CHAT] = function(m_idx)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  m_ptr = monster(m_idx)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  if (m_ptr.r_idx == test_monster_name("Hannah Cooke, a little girl")) then </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          if (quest(AMULET_QUEST).status == QUEST_STATUS_REWARDED) then</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  cmsg_print(TERM_YELLOW, "'Bye!'")</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          else</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  cmsg_print(TERM_YELLOW, "'Are the monsters too tough? </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                                  Do you want to leave?'")</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  if (get_check("Really leave and fail the quest?") == </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                                                  FALSE) </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                          then </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                  cmsg_print(TERM_YELLOW, "'Go and get my </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                                          amulet then!'")</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                          else</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                  cmsg_print(TERM_YELLOW, "'Awww. Never </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                  mind. It was only a bit of rabbits foot'")</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                  quest(AMULET_QUEST).status = </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                                          QUEST_STATUS_FAILED</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                  cave_set_feat(7, 6, 6)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                  cave_set_feat(12, 5, 60)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  end</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          end</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          return TRUE</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  end</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  return FALSE</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">end,              </FONT>

This only looks complicated because of the nested 'if' statements. It's easy to 
lose your way when doing this kind of thing, always make sure you close all the 
statements and put the returns in the right place. <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">HOOK_CHAT</FONT> functions have one 
argument - the monster you are chatting to. As you can see, we perform a check 
to make sure it's the right monster and then away we go.... If the player wants 
to  leave the quest without completion they talk to Hannah, who gives them a 
chance to change their mind! If the player asks to leave the entrance to the 
corridor is blocked off (the second cave_set_feat()) so that the user can't 
then go and get the amulet. Gumband or Zangband players may at this point think 
they've lost out on the rabbits foot of burglary! (they haven't though as it 
doesn't exist in ToME).

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">[HOOK_CHAR_DUMP] = function()</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  if (quest(AMULET_QUEST).status == QUEST_STATUS_FAILED) then</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          print_hook("\n You chickened out of rescuing a necklace and </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                                  made a little girl sad. ")</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  elseif (quest(AMULET_QUEST).status == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETED) or </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          (quest(AMULET_QUEST).status == QUEST_STATUS_REWARDED) or </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          (quest(AMULET_QUEST).status == QUEST_STATUS_FINISHED) then</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  print_hook("\n You rescued little Hannah Cooke's necklace from </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                                                  the nasty monsters ")                   </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  end</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  return FALSE</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">end,</FONT>

This quite simply and obviously prints an appropriate line in the character 
dump based on the status of the quest. the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">n</FONT> bit ensures the text goes on a 
new line, so make sure you include it! Also you should return FALSE as 
returning TRUE will stop executing all the other character dump lines (and you 
may get other quests not having their lines printed.

=== A word about returning TRUE and FALSE ===

As I mentioned above, you need to be careful what you return when dealing with 
HOOKS as you can mess up the game a bit. Bear in mind that if you add a 
function to <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">HOOK_GEN_QUEST</FONT>, every time a quest is generated, that function will 
run. If you return TRUE, then no further functions attached to that hook will 
run. If you return FALSE, it continues processing functions on that hook.

That is pretty much it. Do take a look at the other included scripts that I 
haven't gone into any detail about in the files, as you'll pick up some useful 
techniques there too. Especially worthy of note is the hina.lua file which uses 
hooks outside of the quest structure and also global variables and variables in 
a table. If you have any questions, let me know at the email addy below.
