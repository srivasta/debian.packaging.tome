<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>
A Summoner is, with one exception, a fairly weak class. While he starts 
out a decent enough fighter, his fighting skill doesn't improve that much,
he doesn't cast magic and has little in the way of survival skills. However,
this weakness doesn't trouble him much, because he can summon creatures to
do his bidding and still gain experience from their kills.

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Starting Equipment</FONT>
A Summoner starts the game with:
    A Potion of Healing
    A Short Sword
    A Suit of Hard Leather Armour

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">The summoner's powers of invocation are accessed using the 'm' key.</FONT>
In order to invoke a monster, a summoner must posses a related totem.

There are two kinds of summoning, decided by the totem used:

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Partial Summoning</FONT>
Partial summoning creates a simulacrum of the monster, with little will 
of its own. The Summoner must maintain the simulacrum using mana; when 
he runs out, or stops paying the mana, the simulacrum vanishes.

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">True Summoning</FONT>
True summoning is quite different in effect from Partial Summoning, but the 
two are closely related in usage. A True Totem conjures a full copy of the 
creature in question; the process tends to make the monster a loyal ally to 
the summoner, but this loyalty is not guaranteed, nor is the survival of the 
totem used in the summoning.

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Totem Creation</FONT>
In order to summon any creature, the Summoner needs a totem. Totems cannot be 
found, they must be created through a special process which involves taking 
the corpse of a creature (the summoner need not have been involved in the 
death of the creature in question), and extracting certain essences from it.

The summoner can create a totem using the 'm' command, and unless one is 
working on a unique's corpse, must choose whether the resulting totem is a 
Partial or True Totem.

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Important Note</FONT>
Uniques are very willful creatures by definition, and thus have three special 
rules about their summoning:
1. No partial totem can be made from a unique's corpse.
2. The totem in question is always destroyed.
3. The unique is twice as likely to be disloyal.
