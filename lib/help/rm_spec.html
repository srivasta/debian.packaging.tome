<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>

Another powerful undead creature: the spectre is a ghastly apparition,
surrounded by an unearthly glow. They exist only partially on our
plane of existence: half-corporeal, they can pass through walls, though 
this requires a sacrifice of some of their life-force. As a result 
they cannot rest whilst passing through a wall. 
As undead, they have a firm hold on their life force, see invisible, and
resist poison and cold. They also resist nether.  Spectres make superb
spellcasters, but their physical form is very weak.  Like Zombies,
Spectres gain almost no nutrition from ordinary food.
