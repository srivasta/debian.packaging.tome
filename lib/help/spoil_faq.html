This page contains significant spoilers. Don;t browse it unless you want some 
parts of the game ruined, but don't expect the spoilers to spoil you completely!

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Q: I'm in the Maze, but I cannot find Merton!</FONT>

A: Merton appears on a *random* level between dungeon level 26 (1300') and
36 (1800'). Each maze level is one panel by one panel in size, but *full* of
passageways - so you may have to do quite a bit of tunnelling to search the
whole level.

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">------------------------------------------------------------------------------</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Q: I've found Merton, now what?</FONT>

A: There is a new command that has been added to ToME that allows you to pass 
objects to creatures. What would you try and do if you had a broken leg and 
needed to get back to the town?
<A NAME="07"></A><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">------------------------------------------------------------------------------</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Q: I'm trying to find the Poisoned water quest at Lothlorien, but cannot</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">   find the quest entrance!</FONT>

A: This quest is located in the wilderness. To the west of Lothlorien is 4 
water squares in an upside down L shape. One of these squares will contain the
quest. (Viewed from the Wilderness map).

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Q: I've been given directions to a temple by my God but can't find the </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">   temple anywhere!</FONT>

A: It <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">IS</FONT> there. However, your god's idea of compass directions that are 
not directly on the 4 main axes are probably slightly less acurate than your 
idea. In other words, if your god says it is South-East, s/he means it is 
somewhere in the quadrant that is between the south and east axes.
<A NAME="21"></A><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">------------------------------------------------------------------------------</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Q: Where is the relic by god was talking about? I've looked in the lost </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">   temple and can't find it anywhere!</FONT>

A: It <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">IS</FONT> there. However, when your god told you to look for it VERY  
carefully, s/he meant it. Regardless of your game settings, the relic will only
be created once in the temple, at a random place. If you have searched the 
whole temple once over, and not located it, someone else has found it before 
you, and it is lost forever.
<A NAME="22"></A><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">------------------------------------------------------------------------------</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Q: Apparently my god has lost another piece of his relic and wants me to go </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">   find it again. How many of these are there? </FONT>

A: You can receive up to five god quests, with the final piece yielding an 
extra reward. However you will only receive extra quests if you have 
sucessfully completed all the previous ones. 
<A NAME="19"></A><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">------------------------------------------------------------------------------</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Q: How do I complete the special no-teleport level quests with a Deathmold?</FONT>

A: You will need either some morphic oils, some mimicry skill, or the ring of 
Flare. Deathmolds are marked as experimental for a reason you know. Morphic 
oils can also help if you're having trouble communictaing with monsters. A very
beautiful Elf springs to mind as possibly causing some problems if you are in 
Deathmold form.
