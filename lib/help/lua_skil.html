<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== Introduction ===</FONT>

This is very much in the same vein as adding a racial/extra power, but has to 
be tied into skills, and we're defining more than one spell at once. You should 
have read the <A HREF="lua_intr.html">scripting introduction</A> and 
<A HREF="lua_pow.html">racial power tutorial</A> before going much further. Both of the above files 
contain some fairly fundamental information which you will find necessary for 
full understanding of this file.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== Getting started ===</FONT>

Open construc.lua (you have downloaded the example scripts from 
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">http://www.moppy.co.uk/angband.htm</FONT>, haven't you?). The idea behind this 
script is that it adds a skill which affects you ability to build/knock down 
stuff. It treats the equivalent of stone-to-mud and trap-door destruction 
spells as if they were "building skills". It also adds quite a few high-level 
'spells' which do funky things like carving out corridors and chambers in a 
single turn, and building doors and stuff. Just think of it as if the person 
who has plenty of skills in this area would be a builder-type with lots of 
strength and constitution... 

In order to add these powers we're going to edit the s_info.txt file which 
lives in the edit folder, and add a new skill, underneath the 'misc' tree, 
called construction.  The powers will then be accessed through the 'm' menu, in 
a similar way to mindcraft or alchemy skills or such. (That is, no books are 
needed to cast them, as we're treating them as a craft that has been  learnt, 
rather than spells.) Our fist line of the script file reads:

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">SKILL_CONSTRUCT = 57</FONT>

This merely links the skill index that we'll be defining in s_info.txt to this 
file. We'll come back to this at the end of the tutorial.

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">constructor_powers = add_magic</FONT>

In a similar way to the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">add_power</FONT> function we called when we added the 
Phoenix racial ability, this line calls a special function which we use to 
define new skills. It follows a very specific, but easy to understand form. It 
starts with a brace, which indicates the add_magic function will be storing 
these values in a table. Don't worry about this too much, but understand that a 
table starts and ends with braces <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">{</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">}</FONT> respectively. Each key 
(or field name) takes the format <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"key" = value,</FONT> (the comma is 
important!). 

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  ["fail"] =      function()</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  msg_print("You decide now is a good time for a cuppa")</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  end,</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  ["stat"] =      A_STR,</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  ["get_level"] =         function()</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  return get_skill_scale(SKILL_CONSTRUCT, 50)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  end,</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  ["spell_list"] = </FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"fail"</FONT> is a function that is called whenever you ##fail to cast the 
spells##. Here it does nothing spectacular.
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"stat"</FONT> defines the stat used to cast the spells. Here it is strength. 
Any other stat can be used, prefix it with <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">A_</FONT>.
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"get_level"</FONT> is used to determine the level of the spell. It's associated 
with spells that increase in power the more points that are invested in the 
associated skill. I know that's not terribly clear, I'll come back to it in a 
moment.
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"spell_list"</FONT> is just that, a list of all the spells. 
Each of these four properties within the table must end with a comma. If a 
function is defined in the property itself then we add the comma after the 
closing <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">end</FONT>. Again compare with conmstruct.lua to see it. Any line NOT 
ending wit a comma will cause a lua error on startup, probably of the type 
<FONT COLOR="#000000">'}' expected to close '{' at line <whatever>.</FONT> 

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== The spell list ===</FONT>

Each spell, within the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"spell_list"</FONT> key has it's own set of properties 
that we need to define from a sub-table so we open another set of braces to 
start the spell list, and then a third set of braces to start the first spell. 
So with all this, our first spell looks like:

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  ["spell_list"] = </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  {</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          {</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  ["name"] = </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  ["desc"] = </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  ["mana"] = </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  ["level"] = </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  ["fail"] = </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  ["spell"] = </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  ["info"] = </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          },</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"name"</FONT> is, as you would expect, the name of the spell, as you want it to 
appear in the spell list when choosing a spell. The maximum number of 
characters for this is 29.
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"desc"</FONT> is the description received when you hit the capital letter of 
that spell in the menu. (i.e., press 'a' to cast the first spell, but press 'A' 
to receive info about the first spell. 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"mana"</FONT> is the amount of mana required to cast the spell.
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"level"</FONT> is the level required to use that spell (that's level of the (in 
this case construction) skill, not character level!).
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"fail"</FONT> is base fail rate.
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"spell"</FONT> is the function that is executed when the spell is cast. Note 
that it MUST take the form <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">function() blah end</FONT> even if you're calling
a C function direct. If you have a look at the end of the file, you'll see the 
"rebuild dungeon" spell which is identical to the "alter_reality" spell. 
However, rather than reading <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"spell" = alter_reality()</FONT>, it reads:

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">["spell"] = function()</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          alter_reality()</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">end,</FONT>

which appears to be a long way round to do the same thing, but this is how it 
must be done.

In a  similar way, the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"info"</FONT> key must begin with a <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">function()</FONT> 
and return the value of what is to be displayed along side the spell name, 
level and mana in the spell list. The maximum  number of characters that can be 
displayed here is dependent on the width of the users screen,  but try and keep 
it under 12 if you can, as this will fit in a standard 80x24 terminal screen. 
The first character will need to be a space otherwise you'll have the info line 
squashed right up against the fail rate and it will look odd. If you wish to 
have this part blank in the spell list, you still need to return a value, so 
just a single space will do : <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">return " "</FONT>

All of these keys are repeated for each spell. with each spell in it's own 
table (therefore, it's own set of braces). Again, check the lua file for 
clarification.

When entering the spells in the "spell_list", you must take care to specify 
them in the order which they are gained, otherwise they display incorrectly in 
the spell list.

You should by now be experienced enough to understand most of what's going on 
in the actual spell functions (especially if you dig around in the source a 
bit, and check out Chris Hadgis excellent <A HREF="lua_spel.html">spell.pkg</A> helper 
files. I'm not going to go through the whole file line by line, as this is 
something you should do yourself, figuring out what's going on. I'm going to 
examine a few of the things we haven't covered before though, so pay attention.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== The get_level() function ===</FONT>

Probably one of the most important functions that you see reappearing in the 
file is the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_level()</FONT> function. All this does is return the numerical 
value of the power that is given as the first argument. So <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_level</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">(constructor_power)</FONT> will return the current level of the constructor power. 
Given that the level of this is taken directly from the construction skill, (we 
defined that in the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"get_level"</FONT> key, by saying <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_skill_scale</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">(SKILL_CONSTRUCT, 50)</FONT> ) it will return the value of your construction skill. 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">constructor_power</FONT> is the name of the whole power, we named it thus on 
the second line of the script!

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_level</FONT> takes the following arguments: <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_level(power, max, </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">min)</FONT>. The power is obviously which power we're taking the value from, and the 
max and min allow you to define boundaries for the spell. For instance the 
current maximum value that <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_level(constructor_power)</FONT> can return is 
50, as that is the maximum number of skill points you can have in that skill. 
If you were using this as the basis for the damage of a low-level bolt spell, 
you might decide that having a damage of 50 would be too much (unlikely, but 
still possible). You could therefore define a maximum value of 20 so that when 
the value of the construction skill was over 50, the maximum value for 
damage of that spell would be 20. To achieve this you'd have: 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_level(constructor_power, 20)</FONT>. In a similar way, you can force the 
minimum value of the spell to be higher than the actual construction skill 
level, with a <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_level(constructor_power, 50, 15)</FONT>. This would be useful 
say for spells that you wanted to be available when the construction skill 
level reaches 10, but for whom you wanted a (for example) base damage of 15 
right from the word go. These re-scale values rather than capping them!

You can leave out the minimum value as I have done above. You can also leave 
the maximum value out (it will default to 50). If you want to specify a minimum 
value though, you MUST specify a maximum value as well.

As you have hopefully been able to tell, the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_level()</FONT> function 
enables us to have spells that increase in usefulness as you gain levels. Lets 
take the "Dismantle" spell. The function in the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"spell"</FONT> key is as 
follows:

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">function()</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  local ret, dir, dam</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  if (get_level(constructor_powers, 50) >= 11) then</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          ret, dir = get_aim_dir();</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          if (ret == FALSE) then return end</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          fire_beam(GF_KILL_TRAP, dir, 1)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  else</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">          fire_ball(GF_KILL_TRAP, 0, 1, 1)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  end</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">end,</FONT>

The <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">if</FONT> statement is obviously what really interests us here. You'll 
notice that this has the amendment of an <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">else</FONT> clause, which the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">if</FONT> 
statement we used in the previous tutorial did not. As you would expect, if the 
condition on the first line of this statement is met, then the instructions 
immediately below it are carried out. If the condition is not met, then the 
statements that follow the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">else</FONT> are executed.

Coming back to the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_level</FONT> function, we learnt from above, that the 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_level</FONT> part of this function translates as, "if the value of the 
construction_power level (which happens to be identical to the construction 
skill level) is greater than or equal to 11, cast a beam of trap disarming in 
the specified direction. (The first part of this is all straightforward, 
getting a direction, and cancelling correctly if the player presses 'ESC'.) 
Otherwise, cast a ball of trap disarming with a radius of one, centred on the 
player."

In the same way, as you look at the construc.lua file, you will see that 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_level()</FONT> is used many times in this way, to increase the power of 
detection spells, to change bolt spells to ball spells, to keep a constantly 
increasing damage going, and so on.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== Elseif's and things ===</FONT>

If you want to provide more than one alternative condition, in an 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">if-then-else</FONT> statement, you can use <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">elseif</FONT>s which do what you 
might expect. Take a look at the first spell, "Survey area", for an example of 
this: 

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">if (get_level(constructor_powers, 50) >= 28) then</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  wiz_lite()</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">elseif (get_level(constructor_powers, 50) >= 15) then</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  map_area()</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  detect_traps(DEFAULT_RADIUS)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">elseif (get_level(constructor_powers, 50) >= 5) then</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  detect_traps(DEFAULT_RADIUS)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  detect_stairs(DEFAULT_RADIUS)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  detect_doors(DEFAULT_RADIUS)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">else </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  detect_stairs(DEFAULT_RADIUS)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  detect_doors(DEFAULT_RADIUS)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">end</FONT>

If the level of constructor powers is greater or equal to 28, then the function 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">wiz_lite()</FONT> is performed, and no other part of the if statement is 
executed. <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">wiz_lite()</FONT> is just the enlightenment spell. If it is less than 
28, the next condition is examined: that if the level of constructor powers is 
greater than or equal to 15, then <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">map_area()</FONT>(Magic mapping) and detect 
traps are called. If the level of constructor power is less than 15, it moves 
onto the next condition, which says that if the level of constructor power is 
greater than 5, then detect stairs, traps and doors. If none of these 
conditions are met,(that is, if the level of construction skill is less than 5) 
then we just detect doors and stairs.

You'll note that each of the detection spells includes a DEFAULT_RADIUS 
constant. You could change this to a numerical value, or a variable defined 
somewhere else in your script. eg <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">detect_traps(2)</FONT> would detect traps 
with a radius of 2 centred on the player. 

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== Registering the skill type ===</FONT>

This is what we do at the end of the file, and is what ties the powers we've 
defined to the action of pressing the 'm' key in game. Once more we're calling 
a special function <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">add_mkey()</FONT> which takes it's arguments for a table. 
There are only two keys in this table though which keeps things simple.

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">add_mkey</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">{</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">        ["mkey"] =      MKEY_CONSTRUCT_POWERS,</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">        ["fct"] =       function()</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  execute_magic(constructor_powers)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">                  energy_use = energy_use + 100;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">        end</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">}</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"mkey"</FONT> must be a UNIQUE value > 1000 . Here I've defined it as a 
constant, <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">MKEY_CONSTRUCT_POWERS</FONT>, which has the value 1004. This value 
we'll call again in the s_info.txt file.
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"fct"</FONT> is the function that's called when the user presses the key in the 
'm' menu. SO Here, it calls the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">execute_magic</FONT> function which actually 
displays a list of powers for the user to choose from. The argument it takes is 
the powers it will use (alchemy, mindcraft etc, or in this case constructor), 
and then the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">energy_use</FONT> line tells the game to take one game turn to do 
the action.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== Adding the skill in s_info.txt ===</FONT>

Take a look in the S-info.txt file, under the Misc section. You'll see,

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">N:57:Construction</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">D:Ability to use constructor powers</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">D:Construction powers use strength</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">A:1004:Build or knock down stuff</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">I:1000</FONT>

The first line is the index of the skill, again this must be unique. The second 
property is the name of the skill. The <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">D</FONT> lines are the lines displayed 
when the skill is highlighted in the skill screen.
The first entry on the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">A</FONT> line  is the value of the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"mkey"</FONT> we 
defined in the <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">add_mkey</FONT> function in our script. The second entry is the 
display for selecting the construction power in the 'm' menu.
The <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">I</FONT> line is currently unused, but add a 1000 there anyway. That's what 
all the others have so when it's introduced, at least it will affect your 
powers identically to how it affects all the other powers.

If you scroll to the very bottom of the file now, you'll see I've placed the 
skill at the bottom of the Misc branch of the skills tree. I then made a new 
class, constructor, which you can see in p_info.txt. 

That is all that is NEEDED when writing a script to add a skill - defining an 
mkey using add_mkey, and defining any powers that are called in the 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">"fct"</FONT> (generally using <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">add_magic</FONT> ).

And I've added the line

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">tome_dofile("construc.lua")</FONT>

in init.lua so the script is loaded on start-up!

Below I'm going to talk in depth about a few other functions that you may find 
useful in your scripting.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== fire_bolt() and fire_beam() ===</FONT>

In the last help file we looked at the routine for firing a ball - 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">fire_ball()</FONT>. Here's a quick note about beams and bolts...  
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">fire_beam()</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">fire_bolt()</FONT> take 2 arguments: 
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">(type, direction, damage)</FONT>. So in the dismantle spell we have the 
direction passed from <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">get_aim_dir()</FONT> (the function that asks the player 
for a direction), the type of damage is <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">GF_KILL_TRAP</FONT>, which as you might 
expect disarms traps. And the damage is only 1 because it's not going to hurt 
monsters, just dismantle traps.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">=== set_oppose_elec() ===</FONT>

OK here's another thing. Wander on down to the sparky_skills spell.  After the 
appropriate bolt/ball is fired, we have the line:

<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">if player.oppose_elec == 0 then </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">  set_oppose_elec(randint(10) + 20 + get_level(constructor_powers, 20)*3)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">end</FONT>

This is the bit that grants temporary resist electricity. we've called the 
function <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">set_oppose_elec(turns)</FONT>, which sets the players resist 
electricity to "on" for the time specified in the argument "turns". We're only 
calling this if the player is not already granted temporary resist electricity, 
and we've linked the number of turns it is active for to the level of the 
construction skill. I've limited the maximum value of get_level to 20 in this 
instance. A similar idea can be used for temporarily granting levitation, 
extended infravision, protection against evil, resist fire, stuns, cuts and so 
on and so on. Have a look in player.pkg in the source for a full list....
