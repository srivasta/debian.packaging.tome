<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>
Barbarians are hardy members of their race. They are fierce in combat, and
their wrath is feared throughout the world. Combat is their life: they learn
to feel no fear. Barbarians are, however, suspicious of magic, which makes 
magic devices fairly hard for them to use, and also makes it impossible for 
them to play Mages.
