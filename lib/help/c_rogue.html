<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>
A rogue is a jack of all trades, but the master of none. With the notable 
exception of Archery and Monster-related skills, Rogues are capable of adapting 
to almost any situation. Their strong point lies in stealth and careful 
planning: Where a Warrior would simply hack away (and risk being hacked up 
himself) or a Mage would Manathrust, a Rogue would awaken a monster with a 
dagger in the back, or would wait for the creature to be killed by the line of 
traps she had previously laid between her and her opponent.

Rogues have access to the schools of <A HREF="m_convey.html">Conveyance</A>, <A HREF="m_divin.html">Divination</A> and <A HREF="m_tempo.html">Temporal</A> magic.
