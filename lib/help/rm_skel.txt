#####R=== Skeletal Race ===

#####GDescription
As undead beings, skeletons need to worry very little about poison or 
attacks that can drain life. They do not really use eyes for perceiving 
things, and are thus not fooled by invisibility. Their bones are resistant
to sharp shrapnels (not much to cut there), and they will quickly become
resistant to cold. Should a skeleton be unlucky enough to lose some of his
or her remaining life, he or she will learn to restore it at will. It is 
very hard for skeletons to eat food or drink potions. Although the magical
effects of these will affect the skeleton even without entering the 
skeleton's (non-existent) belly, the potion / food itself will fall 
through the skeleton's jaws, giving no nutritional benefit.
