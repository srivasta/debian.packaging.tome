The temporal school of magic contains spells where magic is used to meddle
in the relationship between time and space. There are rumours of a "Tome of
the Time" which contains all the temporal school spells within it's bindings.

Worshipping the Goddess Yavanna Kementari also gives the ability to cast spells
from the temporal school at a level of 1/6 of your prayer level. e.g. If the
skill "Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 12, you can cast up to level 2
temporal school spells.
