<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>
The Thunderlords are supremely powerful spirits created by Manwe Sulimo,
each riding a Great Eagle. They have the ability to conjure powerful 
thunderbolts, they are telepathic, and gain the ability to use the
Straight Road, which can carry them to any location they have previously been.
Due to their special clothing, they can resist elemental damage.
However, they take a very long time to gain levels as both rider and eagle must
accumulate experience.
