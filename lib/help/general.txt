#####R=== General Information ===

The game of ToME is a single player dungeon simulation.  A player
may choose from a number of races and classes when creating a character,
and then "run" that character over a period of days, weeks, even months,
attempting to win the game by defeating Morgoth, who lurks somewhere in 
the depths of the dungeon.

The player will begin his adventure on the town level where he may acquire
supplies, weapons, armour, and magical devices by bartering with various shop
owners.  After preparing for his adventure, the player can descend into the
dungeon near Bree where fantastic adventures await his coming!
 
You will probably need to browse through the "help files", especially the
one on available *****command.txt*0[commands], before beginning any
serious adventuring...

I'd also highly recommend reading the *****tome_faq.txt*0[ToME FAQ] under
"Extra help for new players" (at least the first section of it about the
differences between Vanilla Angband and ToME).
