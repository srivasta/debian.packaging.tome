<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>
The Monk character class is very different from all other classes. 
Although they can use weapons and armour just like any other class, 
their training in martial arts makes them much more powerful with no 
armour nor weapons. 

As the Monk's skill level rises, new and more powerful forms of attack become 
available. It is also rumoured that the monastic training makes experienced 
monks faster than any other character class!

A Monk might need to wear some kind of armour to gain the resistances necessary 
for survival at higher levels, but if that armour is too heavy, it will 
severely disturb his/her martial arts maneuvers.

If skill points are invested in <A HREF="skills.html#20">Dodging</A>, a Monk's defensive capabilities 
(blocking and dodging) will also increase. However, if armour is being worn, 
dodging is much less effective. Fortunately, a Monk can increase his/her 
ability to fight while still wearing armor by increasing his/her 
<A HREF="skills.html#13">Barehanded-combat</A> skill. 

Monks also have access to the schools of <A HREF="m_meta.html">Meta</A>, 
<A HREF="m_tempo.html">Temporal</A> and <A HREF="m_mind.html">Mind</A> magic.
