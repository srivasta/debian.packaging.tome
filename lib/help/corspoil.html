Sometimes adventurers become exposed to the dark powers of Morgoth. If they 
are unable to resist these powers, they become corrupted. Corruptions can 
change their physical or mental abilities, some of which can be good, and
some bad. Most corruptions will affect you permanently, although some only 
operate when they are activated (whether by player choice or as a random 
event). You can check which corruptions do you have in the knowledge screen 
6 (accessed through the '~' menu) or in a character dump.

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Gaining and (not) losing corruptions</FONT>
There are several ways that you can become corrupted.

You can become corrupted by quaffing a Potion of Corruption or by drinking
from a Fountain of Corruption. Also some strange items can be activated
for corruption.

Corruptions are permanent. Once you have one, you have it for life.
