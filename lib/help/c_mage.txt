#####R=== Mages ===

#####GDescription
A Mage must live by his wits. He cannot hope to simply hack his way 
through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat, 
deceive, confuse, and escape. A mage is not really complete without an
assortment of magical devices to use in addition to his spells. He can
master the higher level magical devices easily and has good saving throws. 

There is no reason a mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells are 
his true realm. For more information on magic schools and spell effects see 
the *****magic.txt*01[Magic help file].
