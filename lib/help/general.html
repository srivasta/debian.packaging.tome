This help system has been designed to be read whilst in-game. Printing it off 
will make it look clumsy and a little difficult to read.

Any text in orange/yellow colour is likely to be a hyperlink, and pressing 
<enter> while the link is active (yellow) will take you to the relevant page. 
Navigate between viewable links by using the left-right keys. Some links also 
have bracketed letters included in the links. Pressing these letters on your 
keyboard will activate the link even if it is orange.

The help files total over 850 kb, so there is a lot of information. They have 
been designed to be browsed, but you may be looking for specific information, 
in which case you should try looking at the alphabetical <A HREF="index.html">index</A>.

Here are all the relevant keypresses for navigating the help system.
