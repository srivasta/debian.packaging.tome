#####R=== Humans ===

#####GDescription
Humans act as a baseline race -- all other races are compared to them. 
Humans can choose any class and are average at everything. Humans tend to 
go up levels faster than most other races because of their shorter life 
spans. No racial adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters choosing 
the human race.

#####GStat Modifiers
None - Humans are the base race.
