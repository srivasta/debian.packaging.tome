Available only to demonologists, or those sufficiently corrupted with
demon-like powers, this school contains spells where demonic energies
are used to create mainly devastating effects.

<FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Demonic equipment</FONT>
Unlike other magic schools, the spells of a Demonologist are not written
in spell books, but are contained within items of demonic origin known as
Demonblades, Demonshields, and Demonhorns (helms), which when wielded allow
the Demonologist to cast spells; each piece of equipment holds three spells.

<FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Demonblade spells</FONT>
1. <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Demon Blade</FONT> (school level 1)
   Imbues your blade with fire to deal more damage.
   At level 30 it deals hell fire damage.
   At level 45 it spreads over a 1 radius zone around your target.
2. <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Demon Madness</FONT> (school level 10)
   Fire 2 balls in opposite directions of randomly chaos, confusion or charm.
3. <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Demon Field</FONT> (school level 20)

<FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Demonshield spells</FONT>
1. <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Doom Shield</FONT> (school level 1)

3. <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Unholy Word</FONT> (school level 25)
