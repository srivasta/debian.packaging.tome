The air school of magic contains spells where the element of air is used
to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of a "Tome of the Blowing
Wind" which contains all the air school spells within it's bindings.

Worshipping the God Manwe Sulimo also gives the ability to cast spells from
the air school at a level of 2/3 of your prayer level. e.g. If the skill
"Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 12, you can cast up to level 8 air school
spells.
