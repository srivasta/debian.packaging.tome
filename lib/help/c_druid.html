<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Description</FONT>
When Melkor first dug up Utumno and Angband, rivers polluted and gave birth to
dark clouds of stinging insects; animals changed into dark, horrible horned
things and the forests themselves screamed in horror at their corruption.

<A HREF="g_yavann.html">Yavanna</A> heard this scream and gave to some of the children of Eru the strength
to defend Nature; at first Ents were chosen, but later on other races were
allowed to thread the path of the Druid.

The embodiment of life itself, a Druid is a true force of nature and nothing
can prevent him from completing his final quest: returning Angband to the
grassy sunlit plain it once was.
