The meta school of magic contains spells where the raw forces of magic are 
manipulated by the spell. There are rumours of a "Tome of Meta Spells" which
contains all the meta school spells within it's bindings.

Worshipping the God Manwe Sulimo also gives the ability to cast spells from
the meta school at a level of 1/3 of your prayer level. e.g. If the skill 
"Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 15, you can cast up to level 5 meta school
spells.

<FONT COLOR="#808080">Meta Spells</FONT>
There are five spells available for the meta school. These Spells are:
1. <FONT COLOR="#808080">Recharge</FONT> (school level 5)
   Taps on the ambient mana to recharge an object's power (charges or mana).
2. <FONT COLOR="#808080">Disperse Magic</FONT> (school level 15)
   Dispels a lot of magic that can affect you, be it good or bad",
   Spell Level 1: blindness and light.
   Spell Level 5: confusion and hallucination.
   Spell Level 10: speed (both bad or good) and light speed.
   Spell Level 15: stunning, meditation, cuts.
   Spell Level 20: hero, super hero, bless, shields, afraid, parasites, 
      and mimicry.
3. <FONT COLOR="#808080">Spellbinder</FONT> (school level 20)
   Stores spells in a trigger.
   When the condition is met all spells fire off at the same time.
   This spell takes a long time to cast so you are advised to prepare it in a
      safe area.
   Also it will use the mana for the Spellbinder and the mana for the selected
      spells.
4. <FONT COLOR="#808080">Tracker</FONT> (dual school level 30)
   Tracks down the last teleportation that happened on the level and teleports
   you to it.
<FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">   Your Meta and Conveyance skills must have reached a combined average level </FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">   of 30 in order to cast this spell.</FONT>
5. <FONT COLOR="#808080">Inertia Control</FONT> (school level 37)
   Changes the energy flow of a spell to be continuously recasted at a given
   interval. The inertia controlled spell reduces your maximum mana by four
   times its cost.
