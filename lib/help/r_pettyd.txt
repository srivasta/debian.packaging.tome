#####R=== Petty Dwarves ===

#####GDescription
A hated and persecuted race of nocturnal dwarves, these cave-dwellers are not 
bothered much by darkness. Their natural inclination to magically enchanted 
items has made them immune to effects which could drain away magical energy, 
and, like ordinary dwarves, they can examine the dungeon to discover traps 
and secret doors.
