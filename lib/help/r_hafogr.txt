#####R=== Half-Ogres ===

#####GDescription
Half-Ogres are a crossbreed between a human and an ogre. They are big, bad, and 
stupid. For warriors, they have all the necessary attributes, and they can even
become priests: after all, they are related to Ogre Magi, from whom they have
learned the skill of setting trapped runes once their level is high enough. Like
Orcs, they resist darkness, and like Trolls, they have their strength sustained.
