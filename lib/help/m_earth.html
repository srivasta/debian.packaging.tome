The earth school of magic contains spells where the element of earth is used
to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of a "Tome of the
Impenetrable Earth" which contains all the earth school spells within it's
bindings.

Worshipping the God Tulkas or the Goddess Yavanna Kementari also gives the
ability to cast spells from the earth school, at a level of 4/5 or 1/2,
respectively, of your prayer level. e.g. If the skill "Spirituality: Prayer"
is at level 10, a worshipper of Tulkas can cast up to level 8 earth school
spells, whereas a worshipper of Yavanna can cast up to level 5 earth school
spells.

There are five spells available for the earth school. These Spells are:
1. <FONT COLOR="#804000">Stone Skin</FONT> (school level 1)

   At spell level 25 it starts dealing damage to attackers.
2. <FONT COLOR="#804000">Dig</FONT> (school level 12)
   Digs a hole in a wall much faster than any shovels.
3. <FONT COLOR="#804000">Stone Prison</FONT> (school level 25)

   At spell level 10 it allows you to target a monster.
4. <FONT COLOR="#804000">Shake</FONT> (school level 27)

   At spell level 10 it can be targeted at any location.
5. <FONT COLOR="#804000">Strike</FONT> (school level 30)
