 Robert Ruehlmann wrote the original Gtk port. Since an initial work is
 much harder than enhancements, his effort worth more credits than
 others.
 .
 Steven Fuerst implemented colour-depth independent X server support,
 graphics, resizing and big screen support for ZAngband as well as
 fast image rescaling that is included here.
 .
 Uwe Siems wrote smooth tiles rescaling code (on by default).
 Try this with 8x8 tiles. They *will* look different.
 .
 "pelpel" wrote another colour-depth independent X support
 using GdkRGB, added several hooks and callbacks for various
 reasons, wrote no-backing store mode (off by default),
 added GtkItemFactory based menu system, introduced
