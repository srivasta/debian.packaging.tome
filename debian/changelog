tome (2.3.10-ah-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    User Interface:
    - Always display list of selectable objects, i.e. remove the option of
      pressing '*' to hide list.
    - GTK2: Allow running with Shift + arrow keys. (Thanks to Lord
      Estraven.)
    - SDL fixes. (Thanks to Lord Estraven.)
    - System-wide character scores were removed. Use the ladder at
      http://angband.oook.cz instead.
    - Panic saves are no longer created. Saving state when memory is
      likely corrupted seems like a bad idea.
    - Remove long-obsolete front-ends.
    - Unix: Removed pointless and error-prone signal handling aimed at
      preventing cheating.
    - Removed gamma correction.
    Game:
    - Killerbunnies: Character dump now lists companions.
    - Killerbunnies: Fix dodge messages.
    - Imported Theme 1.2.0 since this excellent module by Furiosity seems
      to not be downloadable any more.

      for these goes to Lord Estraven.)
    - "Far reaching attack" now works for *all* polearms.

    - Fix for creating "inventory" and "equipment" rules from the
      Automatizer UI. Thanks to morchant for the fix.
    - Fix for Lua code which should hopefully get things working better
      for OpenBSD users. Thanks to Kernigh for the patch.
    - Change "molten glass wall" to use a different internal code to
      hopefully avoid clashes with modules such as Theme.
    - Removed the check on low fuel on your light source when traveling.
      It doesn't make sense since you can already travel without any light
      equipped.
    Build System:
    - Added support for building the GTK2 interface; only lightly tested.
    - Miscellaneous fixes to the CMake files. Thanks to Kernigh for
      contributing these.

tome (2.3.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * [f4042dd] Fix code which needed a 32 bit int to not use int/long
    On amd64, but not on i386, tome produces LUA errors at various
    times. The errors occur at savefile load, when wileding a weapon,
    unweilding a weapon, and for other events. The same homedir, same
    savefiles, same config, same etc., does not produce errors in the
    32bit build of the package.

    The error seems to be that the type Number needs to be a 32bit wide
    integer; and seems to be defined by default as an long, with an option
    to define it as an int for amd64. However, for the 11 arches Debian
    supports, this would lead to a morass of selecting architectures in
    the makefile to override the type; a better solution is to use
    stdint.h and use a type which is 32 bits wide by design: int32_t.

    Bug fix: "frequent LUA errors on amd64, possibly influencing game
    logic", thanks to jrodman@debbugs.spamportal.net</a>; The fix was
    inspired by a different fix proposed by Daniel White.

    This fixes the LUA errors, and             (Closes: Bug#419825)
    This is an important bug fix.
