tome (2.3.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * [f4042dd] Fix code which needed a 32 bit int to not use int/long
    On amd64, but not on i386, tome produces LUA errors at various
    times. The errors occur at savefile load, when wileding a weapon,
    unweilding a weapon, and for other events. The same homedir, same
    savefiles, same config, same etc., does not produce errors in the
    32bit build of the package.

    The error seems to be that the type Number needs to be a 32bit wide
    integer; and seems to be defined by default as an long, with an option
    to define it as an int for amd64. However, for the 11 arches Debian
    supports, this would lead to a morass of selecting architectures in
    the makefile to override the type; a better solution is to use
    stdint.h and use a type which is 32 bits wide by design: int32_t.

    Bug fix: "frequent LUA errors on amd64, possibly influencing game
    logic", thanks to jrodman@debbugs.spamportal.net</a>; The fix was
    inspired by a different fix proposed by Daniel White.

    This fixes the LUA errors, and             (Closes: Bug#419825)
    This is an important bug fix.
