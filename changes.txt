- Bump required level and difficulty rating of Minas Anor quest, as the 
  trees changes have made it just a little harder. -- neil
- The lost temples for god quests now have harder monsters to make the piety
  gain rather more substantial and obvious I hope. Deeper monsters appear 
  as player clvl increases. -- fearoffours
- Fixed the teleport-level ability of Deathmolds, so they 
  can teleport out of a dungeon, instead of getting a
  message saying there's only air above them.  -- WeZ
- A new quest! An ultra ending! "Falling Toward Apotheosis"
  After banning Morgoth spirit in the Void, you can pursue him
  there to forever end the darkness. But beware, it is more than
  likely that you will die. But for the few that succeed, the fame
  will be great!
  Note: you can only do it if you choosed the way of Good and thus
  destroyed the One Ring. An evil ultra ending is planned and will
  come a bit latter.

  -- fearoffours

  improved by Boomerang-mastery, get sold in shops, and are a bit less
  rare -- neil

Player changes:
- Boulder throwing skill :) For Ents .. Don't get used to it as I don't know
  if I'll let it in
- Added dynamic subrace. This means that "things" in the game can somewhat
  change your subrace. This is used by the 3 new Vampire corruptions, which
  when combined will permanently turn you into a full blown Vampire.
  The Vampire subrace has been removed, it might come back as a template for
  the corruptions, or not. All others undead subrace will have the same
  fate. This means that soon you'll be able to turn into an undead rather
  than start as one. The penalties will be tweaked too so we don't end up
  with every char being an undead.
- p_info.txt: Updated, compacted history-chart. Trolls, Orcs, Elves with new
  entries, some other small changes. Deleted the unused races -- masmarangio
- Extra HP bonus(from quest, melkor, ...) is applied before sorcery penality
- Bard class is back(was called Harper before) with a new Music skill.
  Instruments carries the spells, and they work a bit like Psi foci in
  psiband. An instrument (+2) can only play songs that are marked (I) or
  (II) not (III) or (IV)
- Mana is now function of the Magic skill and either INT or WIS, whichever
  is higher
- Probability travel level teleport ability & teleport level spells
  wont work in some dungeon
- Dwarves get a bonus to axe mastery, as they rightfully should
- All mages start with 0.1 less mod to Sorcery. Specialists dont have sorcery.
  Runecrafters dont iether, nor Alchemists. Thaumaturgists do.
  Specialists also get a bit better Spell-power
- The adventurer quest skill reward will now only provide a modifier of 0.3
  if you dont have the skill, but if you have it it will improve the modifier
  by 0.1 if it is below 0.5
- Trolls cannot get the troll blood corruption
- At Monster lore skill level 12 one can turn a pet in a loyal companion.
  Note that you are limited in companion number
- Reduced Necromancy spell failure damage
- Skill multipliers of Rogues and Assassins are higher now. -- neil
- Some skills have more chances to be taugth than others by fumblefinger

- One can now steal from more places -- neil
- Shots now pierce when they used to ricochet in random directions -- neil
- Piercing shots are now togglable -- neil
- If you play something experimental, it now shows up in the character
  dump.  Alchemists and Death Molds are marked as such for now -- neil
- Necromantic magic got a new spell: Necromantic Teeth
- Abilities. Abilities are like skills, but are booleans. That is
  you either know them or not, there is no scale. One can learn
  abilities by spending skill points in the abilitie screen(press 'N').
  Abilities can have prerequisites to be meet before one can learn them.
  (Like some can need a stat level, a skill level, ...)
  Some classes get abilities for free at certain level. Like warriors
  will get Spread-blows ability at level 25 for free(even if they dont
  actually meet the prereqs).
- All classes now get 4 max blows. But there abilities that can increase
  the max. Warriors gets them for free at birth, and other classes also
  get some so they are not less powerful than before the change. This
  will however help people create warrior-mages for example.
- New skill: Geomancy, works in combinaison with the 4 elemental skills
  to produce various effects from the raw elements around teh caster
  (grass, sand, ...). Elementalists becomes Geomancers now.
  Thanks to Fubar Obfusco for the detailed idea
- Runecraft is not gainable from fumblefingers until it is reworked
- Far reaching attack ability. When using a long polearm you can attack monsters
  1 or even 2 grids away(at the cost of a reduced number of blows)
  Idea taken from Adamant
- Trapping is now an ability instead of a skill. Rogues, but not Assassins,
  start with it -- neil
- Undead Form is now an ability
- Thaumaturgy spell levels now range from 1-50 instead of 1-100, so now
  one won't get spells with impossible failure rates, as suggested by
  Jules Bean -- neil

  makefile.std itself is not updated.  Please read comments in main-crb.c.
  -- pelpel
- Module support. It means that people can write ToME "modules" which will
  go in lib/mods and contain "variants" that use the same game engine but
  different lib/foo files. The module selection screen only appears when
  the game detects more than one module. The new -Mfoo command line option
  allows to bypass module selection

  Gtk-specific problem by the way.  Scrolling the map and hitting ^R fixes
  it too, if you prefer menu command -- pelpel
- (Mac, Windows) Added an in-game menu command to view current scoreboard.
  Taken from the latest [V] (Win port only there), minus the use of
  display_scores_aux, which I regard first-degree Mega-Hack -- pelpel

  store.  Seems more like the problem is in z-term (it only updates every
  two columns of the dungeon map...), but it works now -- pelpel

  memory for a long time, I reduced number of channels used to
  4 in Classic and 8 for Carbon  -- pelpel
