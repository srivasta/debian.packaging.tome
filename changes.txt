T.o.M.E 2.3.2 aka "Unrealized Reality" changes

Interface changes:
- If easy_disarm is off, don't trigger known traps while walking normally.
  Added a new extended command "blunder" to let players trigger traps on
  purpose. -- gwooledge
- Lots of documentation, spelling and grammar fixes, including:
  * the now-outdated race/class ability tables, replaced with skill tables
  * the missing documentation for the set of extended commands
  * far too many others to mention here
  -- gwooledge
- Added sanity and speed to the character screen (and hence the text dump).
  Consolidated HP and SP into one line to make room. -- gwooledge
- Allow shopping to use the correct keys in roguelike mode. -- gwooledge
- Push a certain potion type a little deeper into the dungeon -- Neil
- Make piety display light blue when praying, to make it easier to tell
  when you're praying. -- gwooledge
- Don't display ordinary resists when there's also an immunity to the same
  element, in an object description. -- gwooledge
- Display the (colored) character for uniques in the Known Uniques list (~2).
  -- gwooledge
- Add "Check abilities" extended command/macro.  This gives roguelike keyset
  players a way to access the ability screen other than "\N", although it's
  still one more keystroke than "\N" is.... -- gwooledge
- Clean up some offensive messages, patch courtesy of 'The Fury' -- Neil
- Include the resistances grid on character sheets dumped on death.
  This makes them consistent with the ones generated before death, and
  is more informative and useful for post mortem analyses. -- gwooledge
- Examining a totem will recall the monster it summons -- Neil
- Examining a corpse will recall the monster it was -- Neil

Object changes:
- Prevent random artifact bolts from giving extra blows -- Neil
- Correct the types of certain artifact trap sets to match their weights
  and descriptions. -- gwooledge
- Potions of Cure Insanity were too cheap. -- gwooledge

Player changes:
- Warriors no longer get a secret special three bonus blows spread over the
  50 character levels.  The three blows are now tied to Weaponmastery.
  Module authors should adjust accordingly, or their warriors may get three
  blows they didn't have before. -- Neil

Bug fixes:
- Don't allow trap doors on quest levels or on chests. -- gwooledge
- Update view after high-powered globe of light. -- gwooledge
- Don't allow use of stairs (any < or > movement command) while rooted
  to the floor (by the Yavanna spell). -- gwooledge
- Try again to keep traps from wrecking a certain plot element -- Neil
- Fix module file handling for multi-user installs.  Now character sheets,
  automatizer file, and the rest will be read and written in
  ~/.tome/2.3/modulename as they should. -- Neil
- Try harder to save persistent levels when recalling out -- Neil
- Fix all sub-racial skill bonuses, along with Maia racial skill bonuses
  -- Neil
